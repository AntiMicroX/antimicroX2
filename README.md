## Description

AntiMicroX is a graphical program used to map gamepad keys to keyboard, mouse, scripts and macros. You can use this program to control any desktop application with a gamepad on Linux. 
It can be also used for generating SDL2 configuration (useful for mapping atypical gamepads to generic ones like xbox360).

We support X.org and Wayland (Wayland is not supported in flatpak package(.

It allows mapping of gamepads/joystick buttons to:
- keyboard buttons
- mouse buttons and moves
- scripts and executables
- macros consisting of elements mentioned above

This program is currently supported under various Linux
distributions.

This application is continuation of project called `AntiMicro`, which was later abandoned and revived by juliagoda.

Legacy repositories:
- First AntiMicroX repository: https://github.com/juliagoda/antimicroX
- Second, maintained by organization: https://github.com/AntiMicro/antimicro
- First, original AntiMicro repository: https://github.com/Ryochan7/antimicro

## Installation

### Flatpak

The flatpak version is distributed on Flathub, and runs on most major Linux distributions. See instructions here: [Flathub application page](https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.github.antimicrox.antimicrox)

If you have Flathub [set up](https://flatpak.org/setup/) already:

```
flatpak install flathub io.github.antimicrox.antimicrox
```

### Fedora

```
dnf install antimicrox
```

### openSUSE

A [package](https://software.opensuse.org/package/antimicrox) is available.

```
zypper install antimicrox
```

### Arch Linux or Arch Linux based distributions:

```
trizen -S antimicrox
```
**or**

pre-built version can de downloaded from unofficial repository called [chaotic-aur](https://lonewolf.pedrohlc.com/chaotic-aur/).

Append (one of listed mirrors) to `/etc/pacman.conf`:
```bash
# Brazil
Server = http://lonewolf-builder.duckdns.org/$repo/$arch
# Germany
Server = http://chaotic.bangl.de/$repo/$arch
# USA (Cloudflare cached)
Server = https://repo.kitsuna.net/$arch
# Netherlands
Server = https://chaotic.tn.dedyn.io/$arch
```
To check signature, add keys:
```bash
sudo pacman-key --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com -r 3056513887B78AEB 8A9E14A07010F7E3
sudo pacman-key --lsign-key 3056513887B78AEB
sudo pacman-key --lsign-key 8A9E14A07010F7E3
```
Install package
```bash
pacman -S antimicrox
```

### Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions:

Download from the [release site](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox/releases) and install `.deb` package.

### AppImage

Download from the [release site](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox/releases).

It is recommended to use [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) with this package.

### Building Yourself

List of required dependencies and build instructions can be found [here](./BUILDING.md).

## Command Line

Run `antimicrox --help` or read `man antimicrox` for command-line parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Commandline for flatpak</summary>
  In case of flatpak package AntiMicroX can be launched with command:
  <br>
  <code>flatpak run io.github.antimicrox.antimicrox</code> instead of just <code>antimicrox</code>
  <br>
  In some cases it may be good to add alias
  <br>
  <code>alias antimicrox='flatpak run io.github.antimicrox.antimicrox'</code><br>
  fo file <code>~/.bashrc</code>
</details>

## Testing Under Linux

If you are having problems with antimicrox detecting a controller or
detecting all axes and buttons, you should test the controller outside of
antimicrox to check if the problem is with antimicrox or not. The two endorsed
programs for testing gamepads outside of antimicrox are **sdl-jstest**
(**sdl2-jstest**) and **evtest**. SDL2 utilizes evdev on Linux so performing
testing with older programs that use joydev won't be as helpful since some
devices behave a bit differently between the two systems. Another method also exist, 
which can be found [here](https://github.com/juliagoda/SDL_JoystickButtonNames).

## AntiMicroX Profiles

If you would like to send the profile you are using for your application or find something 
for yourself, [here](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox-profiles) is the forked repository. If you want to report a bug, ask 
a question or share a suggestion, you can do that on the antimicrox page or on the
[antimicrox-profiles](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox-profiles) page.

## Support

In order to obtain support, you can post an issue [here](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox/issues).

## Bugs

Application's bugs will be fixed. There are created tests for detecting bugs. Of course, I'm open to proposals or questions from users. 

## Shoutout

A big, original inspiration for this program was the program QJoyPad.

## Participation in the translation of AntiMicroX

If you want to participate in the translation of the program, but your language is not yet on the support list. Please contact us.

However, if your language is already supported in the program, you must have the Qt Linguist program installed, which is usually included in the qt5-tools package, to conveniently translate the application. However, before you do that, make sure that you don't already have this program installed. All you have to do is open it, and then use it to open a file with the ts extension.

If a red exclamation mark appears in the translation field, it means that your translation does not end with the same sign as the original content. Try to place commas or dots in appropriate places and often save your progress.
